- I am currently working as a Software Engineer II in Test at <a href="https://www.infolytx.com/" target="_blank">Infolytx Bangladesh Limited</a> since August 2021. My daily responsibilities as a Software Engineer at Infolytx include designing well-structured test cases, scraping and organizing data from websites, performing non-functional tests (e.g., security test, load test, and performance test). Prior to joining Infolytx, I worked as a SQA Engineer at Technology and Business Solutions Ltd and BitMascot within the period of September 2019 and August 2021. I obtained my Master in Information Technology from University of Dhaka in 2018 and B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology in 2016. While working in different software industries, I've developed a strong passion for computer graphics, animation, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.  My goal is to explore new and exciting ideas in these fields to make a positive impact on people's lives.
